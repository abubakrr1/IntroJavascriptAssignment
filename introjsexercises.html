alert(7%2); <!-- this displays the remainder of the division because it is the remainder operator-->
var name="Jim"; alert(name+" Smith"); <!-- this displays the name Jim Smith because we entered the variable first and added Smith to it as well with the alert--> 
var myNum="5"; alert(myNum+2); <!-- it adds two to the 5 because it alerts the variable plus two so yea -->

<!-- An important difference is that Java is an OOP programming language while JavaScript is an OOP scripting language. Javascript also only runs on browsers while Java works on virtual machines. -->
<!-- = is where you define a variable and == is where you check if something is true or false --> 
<!-- console.log is where you put data into the console log. document.write is where you write on your html page. window.alert is where a window pops up that tells you info. -->
<!-- + is where you add more words to a string (concatenate) . ++ is where you add increments.
<!-- do/while is where you run through the code once and repeats the loop while a condition is true. while is where it runs through the code as long as the condition is true.
